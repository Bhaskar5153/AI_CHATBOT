# AI_CHATBOT
Hello, I have been trying to learn deep learning and nueral networks in AI.
i think as beginner, it would be good exercise to make a chatbot that can read the json data file as input and predict the corresponding output for the questions.
we are going to collect the training data and corresponding target classes in the json file. since machines understand the data in numbers, we need to convert the training data into vectors and put them in sequence. then we use label encoder for the target classes.
we use keras sequencial model and embedding hidden layer to process the sequence vector as input and pick the related response of the corresponding class.
